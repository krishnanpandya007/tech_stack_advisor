## The Problem

Every developer has been here:

- **Analysis Paralysis**: Endless blog posts, Reddit threads, and YouTube videos—yet no clarity
-  **The Hype Trap**: Following trends instead of solving actual problems
-  **Costly Mistakes**: Realizing 3 months in that your stack doesn't scale
-  **No Context**: Generic advice that ignores your team size, timeline, and constraints
